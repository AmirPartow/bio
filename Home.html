                        <p onmouseover="addHighlight(this)" onmouseout="removeHighlight(this)">Welcome to my blog! I was born on <time datetime="1998-07-26">July 26, 1998</time>. My mom chose my name, <strong>Amir</strong>, after her great-grandfather, who was also named Amir. I don't have a nickname, and my last name, <b>Partow</b>, comes from my father's family. I am currently <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 1998);</script> years old.</p>

                        <h2 id="homeH2">Cultural Identity and Migration Experience</h2>
                        <p onmouseover="addHighlight(this)" onmouseout="removeHighlight(this)">I am originally from Turkey, since my parents are from there, but I am Persian by heritage. I was born in Iran and raised in Shiraz, a beautiful city in Fars province. In April 2021, during the peak of COVID-19, I immigrated to Canada because all of my siblings live outside of Iran. My parents still live in Iran, but they sometimes travel here to visit us.</p>

                        <h2 id="homeH2">Balancing Work, Education, and Future Goals</h2>
                        <p onmouseover="addHighlight(this)" onmouseout="removeHighlight(this)">Currently, I work as an Uber driver, which I have been doing for three years. I chose this job because it allows me to be self-employed, and it gives me the flexibility I need while studying English in college. I recently completed the LEAP (Learning English for Academic Purposes) course after 1 year and 4 months. I have also signed up for an Associate Degree in Computer Science, starting in September 2024 at Langara College. My plan is to eventually transfer to a university. Additionally, I hold an Associate Degree in Medical Engineering from Iran.</p>
